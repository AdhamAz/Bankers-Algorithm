# Bankers-Algorithm

#BRIEF: 

This is a simple Python code to implement the Banker's algorithm, the version of Python I used is 3.8.10 and I only needed to import tkinter for GUI purposes.

#DESCRIPTION: 

The code takes certain values for the code to detect whether the system is safe or not. Safety is detected based on many variable that sum up unde the resources header. The certain values the code uses are: 

-  Total Resources: The total number of resources available in the system.
-  Available Resources: The number of available resources for each resource type.
-  Current Allocation: The allocation matrix of each process (row) and the resource type (column).
-  Maximum Need: The maximum needed resources for each process.

If incorrect values are entered or if some values are missing, an error message will pop out for you to see. 

#HOW TO USE:

1) Run the program.
2) Insert "Total Resources" with spaces between each number.
3) Insert "Available Resources" with spaces between each number.
4) Insert "Current Allocation" matrix with spaces between each number and a new line for each row. Be sure to remember that each process is a row.
5) Insert "Maximum Need" matrix with the same format as the "Current Allocation" matrix.
6) A popout message should show once you press the "Check Safety" button to show whether the system is safe or not.
7) A very important step: Have a nice day. :) 

Thank you for reading.
